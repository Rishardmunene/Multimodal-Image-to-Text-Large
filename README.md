# Multimodal-Image-to-Text
This project explores multimodal image-to-text generation using state-of-the-art models. The pipeline integrates SDXL for image processing and caption generation, creating a robust system for converting visual content into descriptive text.

Key Features:
- Modular pipeline architecture for easy extension and modification
- Integration with SDXL model for high-quality image understanding
- Image processing utilities for preprocessing and augmentation
- Text processing capabilities for caption refinement

The project structure is organized into clear components:
- `config/`: Configuration files for model and pipeline settings
- `src/pipeline/`: Core pipeline implementation
- `src/models/`: Model wrapper implementations
- `src/utils/`: Utility functions for image and text processing

This experimental project aims to advance the field of multimodal AI by providing a flexible framework for image-to-text generation research.
